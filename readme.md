[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saeedvaziry/task-menu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saeedvaziry/task-menu)

## Here what i did and didn't

* Implementing API as you need
* Wrote tests for all API requests
* I didn't used Policies because you was removed the `User` model and commented `AuthServiceProvider` by default.
* Created `Requests` for all api end points
* Used `API Resource` for sending responses
* I did everything in SOLID principles
* Used `Fakers` in tests.
* Added travis ci to project. You can see build status at the top.
